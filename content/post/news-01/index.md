[IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI)](https://www.embs.org/jbhi/) publishes original papers describing recent advances in the field of biomedical and health informatics where information and communication technologies intersect with health, healthcare, life sciences and biomedicine. Papers must contain original content in theoretical analysis, methods, technical development, and/or novel clinical applications of information systems. Retitled from the IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine (T-ITB) in 2013, the J-BHI is one of the leading journals in computer science and information systems with a strong interdisciplinary focus and biomedical and health application emphasis. Topics covered by J-BHI include, but are not limited to: acquisition, transmission, storage, retrieval, management, processing and analysis of biomedical and health information; applications of information and communication technologies to the practice of healthcare, personal well-being, preventive care and early diagnosis of diseases, and discovery of new therapies and patient specific treatment protocols; and integration of electronic medical and health records, methods of longitudinal data analysis, data mining and knowledge discovery tools. Manuscripts may deal with these applications and their integration, such as clinical information systems, decision support systems, medical and biological imaging informatics, wearable systems, body senor networks, informatics in biological and physiological systems, personalized and pervasive health technologies (telemedicine, u-, p-, m- and e-Health) for public health, home healthcare and wellness management. Topics related to integration include interoperability, protocol-based patient care, evidence-based medicine, and methods of secure patient data.
